	- Song: Sucker for Pain
	- Once the music stops, each student with a potato will have to answer a question posed by the teacher (based on the questions we went over in class).

## Debrief:
Today, we went over introduction. Introductions are important because that is the way people "officially" met. I saw "officially" meet because it is people to know people you never met. Some examples of this are movie stars and pop stars. We know a lot about them, but we have never "officially" met, as such, we have never had to introduce ourselves to them. Other examples, include friends of your family, your friend's family members, etc. Your family and friends may talk about about a number of people that you have not met. As a result, you will know a little about them before you ever meet them. However, once you meet them and "officially" meet, you will have to introduce yourself.

## Anticipated Problems/Activities:

- How do you know they are family?
- How do you know they are coworkers?
- Can family be friends?
- Can coworkers be family?
