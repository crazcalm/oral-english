## Script:
- Son: Hi dad! Hungry!

- Dad: Starving. I didn't have time for lunch, got caught in a traffic jam, and had to sit for 10 minutes staring at a billboard of the best looking burger on a rope I have ever seen. Let's eat!

- Dad: Hi hon!

- Mom: Hi Al. I made something different.

- Dad: I don't care, just slide it in front of me and plenty of it.

- Mom: Okay. Here is comes.

- Dad: Ah, just skip the salad. Let's just eat, okay?

- Mom: That's dinner Al. You've got your  riboflavin, folacin, iron and magnesium, all right there.

- Dad: Come on, Peg. Where's my food?

- Mom: That's it, Al. You finish that, and you can have a granola bar for dessert.

- Daughter: Ooh, beats the heck out of the pie we usually have, huh, Dad?

- Dad: Okay, Peg. What did I do?

- Mom: Nothing. It's good food. It's going to make us much healthier and much more energetic. Try it.

- Dad: Sure.

- Dad: Gee, you know, you're right. I doubted you, but I feel a burst of energy coming.

- Dad: Here it comes now.

- Dad: Here comes another wave. What are you doing to me? I work. I want food. You know what food is? It's hot stuff you put in your mouth. It smells good, you swallow it, and you want more.
That's what food is.

- Mom: Al, the children are here.

- Dad: Oh, I'm sorry.

- Dad: Now, I'm gonna watch the news. And when it's over, I want some form of dead animal on my plate.
