- Llama: That's a question and I'm not answering it. So there.

- Dot: This is fun.

- Wakko: Just one isty bisty question

- Llama: No!

- Dot: Your mouth may say no.

- Wakko: But your eyes say yes.

- Llama: What a minute. I am the great Wally Llama, the wisest being on Earth. I must use my smarty brains. Ah, I know where they will never find me.

- Llama: (Screams)

- Yakko, Wakko, and Dot: Hello Llama!

- Llama: Go away please.

- Yakko: Okay, fine. We know when we are not wanted. We can take a hint you know.

- Yakki: Come on sibs, he probably doesn't know the answer to our question anyway.

- Llama: There is no question I do not know the answer to.

- Yakko: Yeah, yeah, but you wouldn't know the answer to this one. Just... Ah, just forget it.

- Llama: But I know. I know everything.

- Yakko: No you don't. Not this.

- Llama: There is no question in the world I do not know. Go head ask me. Ask me.

- Yakko: I thought you weren't answering any questions.

- Llama: Well, I'm not. Just this one. To prove to you that I know everything.

- Yakko: Well... okay. Here's our question. Why do hot dogs come in packages of 10 and hot dog buns come in packages of 8?

- Llama: I... I... I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I.. I... I... (Goes crazy)

- Yakko: Maybe we should just write Dear Abby.
