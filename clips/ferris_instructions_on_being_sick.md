## Script:
The key to faking out the parents is the clammy hands. Its a good non-specific symptom. I am a big believer in it. A lot of people will tell you a good phony fever is a dead lock, but, eh, you get a nervous mother, you could wind up in a doctor's office. That is worse than school.

You fake a stomach cramp. And, when you're bent over moaning and wailing, you lick your palms. It is a little childish and stupid, but then again, so is high school.
