## Script:
- Dad: I didn't tell you because I know you think vacations are a waste of time.

- Mom: I thought you thought that too.

- Dad: Whelp, I need this. A couple days away recharges me. Its how I stay so positive.

- Mom: Oh, so you think I don't need a break too. The difference is I just can't checkout for a few days or our whole family would fall apart.

- Dad: That's not true. You could loosen the reigns a little. We'll be fine.

- Mom: No. That's what you think, but if I do...

- Dad: What? We splurge a bit. Spend a little money. We can afford to. It is apart of being on vacation.

- Kid in Sleeping bag: Preach it big man!

- Dad: Look. We work hard all year. No one harder than you. Just let go for a day and relax.

- Mom: I don't know how to relax. It seems like a waste of time. I could be marinating meat or driving.

- Dad: It's easy. I'll show you. First...

- Mom: aahhhh, yeahhhh

- Dad: No no no no no no no no. I know its free, but its freezing in here.

- Dad: See, a part of being on vacation is enjoying yourself. I'm going to book you a massage at the spa.

- Mom: No! No!

- Dad: Up, bub. Loosen the reigns, remember? Let me handle this. Now you put on the hotel robe and slippers.

- Dad: Go on.
