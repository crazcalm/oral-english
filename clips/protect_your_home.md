## Script:

- Al: I can't believe they stole my radio right in front of my house.

- Steve: I know how you feel.

- Al: If you did Steve, you wouldn't be touching me.

- Marcy: Maybe we should get more involved with the neighborhood watch.

- Al: Look. You can't depend on anybody but yourself. I've put this off long enough. I'm buying a gun.

- Marcy: A gun is not the answer. You can't curtail the criminal element by sinking to their level.

- Al: Oh, excuse me, Miss Let's-run-them-over and-get-out the-fishhooks.

- Marcy: I was upset. I wasn't thinking clearly.

- Peggy: Yes. She wasn't using the left, or analytical, portion of the brain.

- Al: I'm definitely getting a gun. And I'd advise you to do the same.

- Steve: Now, come on. There's got to be a more humane way to protect our home and possessions.

- Marcy: There is. We'll get a dog. A good watch dog.

- Al: A dog. That's a great idea. I've got a dog. Buck, look! Strangers in the house! Kill them, Buck. Go kill them! Whoa, big fella.

- Marcy: I don't mean a stupid dog. I'm talking about a real dog. A guard dog. A Doberman.

- Marcy: Steve, first thing tomorrow, we're going to one of those deadly doggy places.

- Steve: Yes, Al, because we're against guns and the violence they stand for.

- Marcy: That's right.
