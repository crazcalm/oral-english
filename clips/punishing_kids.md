## Script:
Dre: Okay, speaking of family, I have a question. Were any of you spanked as kids?

Male blue shirt: Sure was. My dad used to have a Rob Roy, then beat me with his dress shoe.

Male pink shirt: My mom used to put rings on just to spank me.

Lady long sleeved shirt: My mom used to crack me in the skull with a rolling pin.

Dre: Good lord, that's horrible!

Lady long sleeved shirt: Indian ones are smaller, but still, it was a rolling pin.

Male green shirt: My parents didn't believe in spanking, and I turned out awesome.

Male green shirt: Hey, what do they do to kids in China?

Lady sleeveless shirt: Uh, no idea. I grew up in Torrance, and I'm Korean.

Dre: Who thinks they were better off being spanked?

Crowd: Oh, totally.

Male blue shirt: I do. Definitely. And this country is losing ground because we're no longer spanking. Our kids are last in everything.

Male green shirt: It's true. All the countries that are beating their kids are beating our ass.

Dre: Well, I'm convinced. I'm gonna spank my son.

Male green shirt: That's a terrible idea.

Male blue shirt: Whoa, whoa, whoa. No! Now, wait a minute. You were talking about your own child?

Dre: Yes.

Male green shirt: Which one? The big one or the little one?

Dre: The little one.

Male green shirt: Oh, come on!

Male pink shirt: Not Jack! He's our favorite!

Male blue shirt: What are you, a monster?

Dre: I thought you guys were all for spanking?

Lady long sleeved shirt: In the abstract, yeah, but you don't hit your own child. Who does that?
