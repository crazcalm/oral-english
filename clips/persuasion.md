## Script:
### Part 1
Al: Listen, you know the kind of room I think you and Marcie really need? A poolroom for you and me.

Marcy: I don't know. I think Marcy and I should get a room we both like.

Al: She's got one. She's got the kitchen.

Al: You need something to fill up your life and I think this room is the perfect thing. See, Steve, remember how great it was when you were a kid and you had your own room, and you had the privacy to do whatever you wanted to? You can do those things again Steve.

Steve: I don't need to do that anymore. I've got a wife now.

Al: And a terrific little wife she is too. She would never stand in the way of you wanting your poolroom.

Al: Listen, think of it, Steve. A little refrigerator for your beer. A little powder on your hands. That feeling of the cue stick sliding through your fingers. That squeak of the chalk.
But most of all, that feeling of adrenaline coursing through your veins as you make that two-cushion bank shot.

Steve: [SIGHS] Gee.

### Part 2

Peggy: That was a great workout. You want some pie?

Marcy: Sure. It really does give you an appetite, doesn't it? 

Peggy: Ah, the boys are at your house, talking about your new room. So, what kind of room is this going to be?

Marcy: An all-purpose room.

Peggy: What a waste. Why not build a room with a purpose? Like an exercise room for you and me. Ice cream?

Marcy: Sure.

Peggy: Gee, an exercise room would be great. Then we wouldn't have to wait in line to use their equipment and be laughed at by women with good bodies. Chocolate sauce?

Marcy: Okay.

Marcy: I don't know, Peggy. Steve and I wanted a room we could both use.

Peggy: Oh, Steve has his own room. He has the kitchen. Besides, aren't you sick of dragging me along each week to be your free guest at the health club? I mean, they know I'm not gonna join.
Doesn't that embarrass you?

Marcy: Well, not as much as you stealing towels.

Peggy: Hey. That sign said: "Guest towels. Take one." Look, Marcy, if you build an exercise room, not only will you look better, but you'll live longer.
And isn't that the best possible present you could give Steve? Whipped cream?

Marcy: What the heck. I'm gonna have an exercise room, right? 

Peggy: Right.
