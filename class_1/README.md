# Template
## Purpose:
This directory is an example of how each class directory will be structured.

## Presentation Directory:
The presentation directory is a renamed copy of the reveal.js [release](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/releases). Documentation for reveal.js can be found on their github page at <https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js>

## Img directory:
If you would like to add images to you presentation, then you should add a img directory to the presentation directory and place your images there.

If you are having trouble scaling your image to a usable size, I created a simple command line script called Scaler. That tool can be found at <https://github.com/crazcalm/scaler>
