## Cocktail Party
Give each student a 3X5 card. Include the teacher (T). Have students (Ss) write their English name at the top (Have Ss Choose English name first or if none, Chiense name in pinyin). Collect cards. Give each Ss someone else's card. Write some questions on the board (What are your hobbies, favorite food, what did you do over break, etc). Ss should interview the person whose card that they have. Can take notes on one side of the card. Will also be interviewed by one other Ss. Should sit down when finished. When everyone has finished, teacher begins. T introduces the student he/she interviewed (Ss A) then sits down and turns over Ss A's card about Ss A (i.e. language difficulties, personality traits, public speaking skills, etc) Then Ss A gives T the card he/she has and the person who Ss A introduced than stand up to speak. T should take notes on the back of all cards about each person's speaking ability. If the chain breaks, have extra paper handy to take notes on the Ss. If Chain breaks, just choose a Ss who hasn't spoken yet to go next.

## Hands On Biography
Students should trace their hand on a piece of paper and write "answers" to 10 questions about themselves (For example, a student might write '12' on his/her hand because that is his/her age). Students then form two lines facing each other. Both students hold up their pictures. Each student should ask questions to his/her partner to try to get their partner to answer by using one of the words on his/her hand. The student should cross off the word once they say it. The teacher should tell the class to switch every 30 seconds or so by having one side of the line move to the left (or right) one person. The teacher should model this "switching" before the students even stand up. Can draw a diagram on the blackboard. The teacher should pay attention to when most students have crossed off words and end the activity when appropriate. Before students draw their hand, the teacher can review examples of questions by writing them on the board (Example, where are you from? What is your favorite food?) Then the teacher should model the activity. The teacher should leave his/her hand up on the blackboard while the students are drawing their own hand in case they need help coming up with a words to to write on their hand.

## Three Act Play
There is a particular play that goes along with this activity but can also create your own play or use with a different one. Divide students into groups of 5 or 6 (one student per role). Give each person a script. Read through the script as a class (may need to have students repeat line after line, review vocab, review intonation, etc.). In their groups, tell students to practice the script twice at regular speed. Tell the students to practice it in slow motion (focuses on accuracy). Tell the students to practice it at high speed (focus on fluency). Can have the students switch roles and practice again. Give each group a chance to preform the play in front of the class (they can choose the speed).

## Hot Potato
Play music, pass the potato. When the music stops, ask that student a question. If using to review, can ask the student to write as many words as they know for categories you give them. Then, when the teacher asks a question, the student must answer using one of those words.

## Telephone
Divide class into groups of (pick a number), and arrange each group in a straight line or row. Ask for a volunteer listener from each group. Take them outside of the classroom and give them a message (one sentence of more, depending on the student's level). Open the door and let the students run to the first member of their group to whisper the message. Each member passes the message, by whispering, to their neighbor. When the message reaches the end, the last person should run to the board and write the message that they heard.

The winner could be determined in various ways: first team to pass a legible, complete message (even if it is wrong), first team to finish, first team with a message closest to the original.

## Simon Says
Teaching verbs and/or parts of the body. As a class, play Simon says. If a student makes a mistake, that student will go to the front of the class and lead Simon Says. You may break the class into smaller groups and have them play on their own.

## Two Truths and a Lie
Everyone writes down three statements: Two that are true and one that is not true. The teacher first states his/her three statements and students guess which one they think is the lie. Put students in groups of four. Have each person read/tell their statements to the group and have the group guess which statement is not true. Or, can ask for a few volunteers to read their statements to the whole class. This can also be used to review content material. Students write down three statements, two that are correct and one that is not correct and then follow the directions above.

## Salad Bowl
Ask everyone to write down a single word on a slip of paper. Fold up all the papers and place them into a salad bowl.

Slip the group into two teams. There are three rounds in the game and each round is played in a similar way. To start, a person from the first team picks a word out of the salad bowl and his teammates try to guess the word. Once the word is guessed, the same player picks another word quickly from the salad bowl for his teammates to guess. He keeps picking up words until his 1 minute turn is up (you need a timer to keep track). After one minute, give the team 1 point for every correct word that was guessed. Once the first team finishes, the next team goes until all the words in the salad bowl are guessed.

Round one: verbal clues
The player picks a word from the bowl and describes it to his teammates without saying the actual word. Once the word is correctly guessed, he can select another word from the bowl for his teammates to guess.

Round two: charades
In this round, the player picks a word from the salad bowl and must act it out without talking.

Round three: One word clue
For the last round, a player picks a word from the bowl and gives 1 clue to get his teammates to guess the correct word.

## Strip Story
Give each student a sentence/part of a story. Have the students work together to put the story in order by standing in a line with their sentence strips. Divide the class into groups of 8-10 students when doing this activity. Can review by having a couple  groups read their story by each person reading their sentence out loud.

## Chain Story

Oral or written: Teacher begins a story either on paper or orally. Students are in groups and one-by-one must continue the story. If you do a written version, good idea to have multiple stories going around at once so that students are kept busy. If you do a written story, can tell the groups to choose the best one and read it to the class.

## Find Someone Who

Have a handout with a list of "Find someone who" statements (Find someone who drank milk with their breakfast this morning). Have students mill around asking their peer's names. Each peer's name can only be written down once. Review by randomly calling on students or ask a student to "be the teacher".

## Fizz Buzz

One person starts counting and it moves around the group. Everytime it gets to a multiple of 5 (eg 35) that player must say 'fizz' instead of the number, then it carries on. Everytime it gets to a number with 7 in it (eg 17, 27, 72) that player must say 'buzz' instead of the number. If any number falls into both categories then the player must say 'fizzbuzz'.

Heres an example:

- Player 1: 1
- Player 2: 2
- Player 3: 3
- Player 4: 4
- Player 1: Fizz
- Player 2: 6
- Player 3: Buzz
- Player 4: 8
- Player 1: 9
- Player 2: Fizz etc..
 
## Guess the local place

1. Divide the class into teams. Then set the children a challenge. They have to write three clues about a local building or place of interest. The trick is to write ambiguous clues, so that the answer is not immediately obvious, or could refer to more than one place. See Box 35 for examples.

2. Team members take turns to read out a clue. If a rival team makes an
incorrect guess, they are out of the game. If they guess the place after one
clue, they score three points; after two clues, they score two points; and
after three clues, they score one point. If no other team can guess the
place, then the writers of the clues score three points.

## Blind Guide

Place landmarks within the classroom. For example, one corner can be home, another can be school, etc. 

Break the students into pairs. One student will use their hands to cover their eyes while the other student will received a list of locations that he/she must guide their partner to.

Note: you may only use words to communicate. You are not allowed to physically guide your partner to their destination.
