## Cocktail Party
Give each student a 3X5 card. Include the teacher (T). Have students (Ss) write their English name at the top (Have Ss Choose English name first or if none, Chiense name in pinyin). Collect cards. Give each Ss someone else's card. Write some questions on the board (What are your hobbies, favorite food, what did you do over break, etc). Ss should interview the person whose card that they have. Can take notes on one side of the card. Will also be interviewed by one other Ss. Should sit down when finished. When everyone has finished, teacher begins. T introduces the student he/she interviewed (Ss A) then sits down and turns over Ss A's card about Ss A (i.e. language difficulties, personality traits, public speaking skills, etc) Then Ss A gives T the card he/she has and the person who Ss A introduced than stand up to speak. T should take notes on the back of all cards about each person's speaking ability. If the chain breaks, have extra paper handy to take notes on the Ss. If Chain breaks, just choose a Ss who hasn't spoken yet to go next.

## Hands On Biography
Students should trace their hand on a piece of paper and write "answers" to 10 questions about themselves (For example, a student might write '12' on his/her hand because that is his/her age). Students then form two lines facing each other. Both students hold up their pictures. Each student should ask questions to his/her partner to try to get their partner to answer by using one of the words on his/her hand. The student should cross off the word once they say it. The teacher should tell the class to switch every 30 seconds or so by having one side of the line move to the left (or right) one person. The teacher should model this "switching" before the students even stand up. Can draw a diagram on the blackboard. The teacher should pay attention to when most students have crossed off words and end the activity when appropriate. Before students draw their hand, the teacher can review examples of questions by writing them on the board (Example, where are you from? What is your favorite food?) Then the teacher should model the activity. The teacher should leave his/her hand up on the blackboard while the students are drawing their own hand in case they need help coming up with a words to to write on their hand.

## Three Act Play
There is a particular play that goes along with this activity but can also create your own play or use with a different one. Divide students into groups of 5 or 6 (one student per role). Give each person a script. Read through the script as a class (may need to have students repeat line after line, review vocab, review intonation, etc.). In their groups, tell students to practice the script twice at regular speed. Tell the students t practice it in slow motion (focuses on accuracy). Tell the students to practice it at high speed (focus on fluency). Can have the students switch roles and practice again. Give each group a chance to preform the play in front of the class (they can choose the speed).
