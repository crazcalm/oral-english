## Assessment plans
### Initial
I will find a video clip of people giving introductions. We will watch the video 3 times. The students will have a sheet of things to look for in the video. During the first of the video, I will observe them while they watch the video. Based on their reaction, I will either directly play the video again or asked them a few simple questions before playing the video again. After the second take of the video, I will ask them some questions and then play the video again. After the third take, I will go over the sheet with them. If I believe their levels are higher/lower than expected, I will then modify the rest of the lesson to their level.

### Final
A group presentation where each groups chooses a topic to present on using three prospectives (friends, family, and work professional setting). The presentation must last at least 10 minutes. Each person must speak for at least 2 minutes. The presentation must include at least 8 sentence structures studied throughout the course and topic must be approved by the teacher. A draft/script/outline of the presentation must be submitted at least one day before the presentation.
	
I will try to limit the topics to the ones covered in class. As such, I am able to compare their presentation to the content that was covered in class. Having the students approach the same topic from three different perspectives allows me to judge their presentation based on their understanding of how the social customs of these groups are different. Having each person speak for at least 2 minutes allows me judge their English. Having them turn in a draft allows me to gain a basic expectation of what I can expect from their presentation and it gives me a reference that I can use post their presentation to help me with grading.

## Speaking goals:
* **A** Can hold conversations in fairly fluent English with native English-speakers on familiar topics, maintain the conversation or discussion, and agree or disagree with the other party.
* **B** Can give directions, make explanations and answer difficult questions using relatively complicated language, when looking at maps or using instruction manuals.
* **C** Can express personal emotions, for example, surprise, likes, and dislikes, depression, and complaints, and give personal opinions on certain events.
* **D** Can tell a complete story, for example, how it happened, developed in the past or a personally experienced event. Can express wishes and hopes, for example, about a travel plan or ideal job.
* **E** Can answer questions in class, use familiar simple expressions and sentences to exchange opinions with classmates, and give short prepared speeches on familiar topics.
* **F** Can introduce myself, classmates and friends, and respond to other people's introductions.
* **G** Can give directions, do shopping, leave messages.
